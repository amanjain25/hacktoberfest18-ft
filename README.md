## What is Hacktoberfest'18?

Hacktoberfest is a global event which motivates open source contributors to boost up their contribution. As well as it is a month-long celebration of open source software in partnership with GitHub. In addition to that by contributing to this challenge you can earn a limited edition T-Shirt.

## First Contributions

It's hard. It's always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes isn't a comfortable thing. I wanted to simplify the way new open-source contributors learn & contribute for the first time.

## What should I do next for Hacktoberfest'18?
  1. If you wanted to offer more code changes to this repo you could edit/add any files/code and then follow a similar workflow.

  2. You could alternatively look at any github's "Issues" tab. That is where people make requests to the public for your contributions aka "pull requests"

  3. You can contribute anywhere. Sometimes repo maintainers are more receptive to pull requests than others. It often is recommended to make smaller changes and see how the maintainers respond to your requests. Ideally they merge in your changes, that is the point of a pull request, you are attempting to contribute to a larger project that you do not own.

## Or you could check out one of these lists:

- [Main site suggestions](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/#projects)

- [All GitHub issues labeled Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/search?q=label:hacktoberfest+state:open+type:issue)

- [All GitHub issues labeled Hacktoberfest and a language like JavaScript](https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&q=label%3Ahacktoberfest+state%3Aopen+type%3Aissue&type=Issues)

## A word of caution
  When working with git with a world wide team you may be making changes at the same time someone else is, if you both change the same file there could be "merge conflicts". Rememeber to "git pull" or "git fetch" and resolve merge conflicts locally before attempting to create a "pull request".

## There are many ways to create a pull request
  1. You can fork a project and compare across forks. Choose this option if you plan to contribute more than once.
  2. Or you can edit the original github repo's code directly. Choose this option if you have a quick contribution.
