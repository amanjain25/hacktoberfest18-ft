## What is Hacktoberfest'19?

Hacktoberfest® is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a developer, student learning to code, event host, or company of any size, you can help drive growth of open source and make positive contributions to an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skill levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

- Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
- Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.
- Sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

## Rules
To qualify for the official limited edition Hacktoberfest shirt, you must register and make four pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). PRs can be made to any public repo on GitHub, not only the ones with issues labeled Hacktoberfest. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate. This year, the first 50,000 participants who successfully complete the challenge will earn a T-shirt.

## First Contribution

## What should I do next for Hacktoberfest'19?

1. If you wanted to offer more code changes to this repo you could edit/add any files/code and then follow a similar workflow.

2. You could alternatively look at any github's "Issues" tab. That is where people make requests to the public for your contributions aka "pull requests"

3. You can contribute anywhere. Sometimes repo maintainers are more receptive to pull requests than others. It often is recommended to make smaller changes and see how the maintainers respond to your requests. Ideally they merge in your changes, that is the point of a pull request, you are attempting to contribute to a larger project that you do not own.

## Or you could check out one of these lists:

- [Main site suggestions](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/#projects)

- [All GitHub issues labeled Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/search?q=label:hacktoberfest+state:open+type:issue)

- [All GitHub issues labeled Hacktoberfest and a language like JavaScript](https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&q=label%3Ahacktoberfest+state%3Aopen+type%3Aissue&type=Issues)

## A word of caution

When working with git with a world wide team you may be making changes at the same time someone else is, if you both change the same file there could be "merge conflicts". Remember to "git pull" or "git fetch" and resolve merge conflicts locally before attempting to create a "pull request".

## There are many ways to create a pull request

1. You can fork a project and compare across forks. Choose this option if you plan to contribute more than once.
2. Or you can edit the original github repo's code directly. Choose this option if you have a quick contribution.
